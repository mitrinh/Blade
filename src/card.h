//    Description:      A card game based on the minigame in the "Trails" video game franchise.
//                  -The game is set up with a deck of 44 cards and is shared between 2 players holding 10 cards taken
//                      10 cards from the deck.
//                  -The cards have their own value or score whenever they are played.
//                  -At the start of the game, both players play a card from the top of the deck and whoever's score is
//                      lower goes first.
//                  -The win condition is to "checkmate" the other  player so that their score is lower than yours after
//                      they play a card.
//                  -Whenever both scores are equal,clear all played cards and current scores then start the game again.
//                  -There are 2 types of cards: regular cards of values 1-7, and special cards which have a base value
//                      of 1 when played from the deck or an effect depending on the card when played from the hand.
//
//                  -There are 4 different special cards: blast, bolt, force, and mirror.
//                      -blast lets you choose a random card from your opponent's hand and discard, then lets you play
//                          again.
//                      -bolt negates the opponent's last played card's value if it is regular or force. Cards that have
//                          been bolted can be restored by a regular "1" card.
//                      -force doubles the score of your played cards.
//                      -mirror swaps the opponent's played cards and score with yours.
